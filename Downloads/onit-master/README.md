# Onit Bank — React Skeleton

A minimal React + Vite project skeleton for the Onit Bank microfinance website.

## What’s included
- Pages: `Homepage`, `About`, `Services`, `Contact`
- Shared components: `Navbar`, `Footer`
- React Router for navigation
- Basic styles in `src/index.css`
 - Tailwind CSS set up and ready to use

## Setup (Windows Powershell)

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\sharo\OneDrive\Desktop\onit"
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
```

## Next steps
- Add types or TypeScript support if you'd prefer strong typing
- Expand component layout and mobile responsiveness
- Add a global state (Context/Redux), tests, and CI
- Replace placeholder text and assets with real brand content

## Tailwind details
Tailwind CSS was added to this project. The configuration files include `tailwind.config.cjs` and `postcss.config.cjs`. Use Tailwind utility classes in JSX — some pages already use basic Tailwind classes.

Happy building! ⚡️
